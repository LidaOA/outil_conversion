# CONVERTER TOOL

**The goal of this project is to create a simple currency converter that takes a value in one currency and converts it into another currency based on the current exchange rate. This can be useful for individuals or businesses who need to quickly and easily convert currencies for transactions or financial planning.**

The currency converter will need to fetch the latest exchange rates from a reliable source, such as a financial API or a central bank website. It will then use this data to perform the conversion calculation and display the result to the user.

**The exchange rates data used for this project cannot be swaped without modifying the code.**

The website providing the data : https://www.mataf.net/fr/conversion/

Overall, this project aims to provide a convenient and efficient tool for converting currencies, helping users make informed financial decisions and transactions.

About 15 currencies are allowed.

**You need to have Qt Creator installed on your computer !** (The version prefered is 6.5.2)
